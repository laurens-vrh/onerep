			responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and
			password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to
			accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or
			password. You agree to notify OneRep immediately of any breach of security
			or unauthorized use of your account. By providing OneRep your email
			address, directly or when signing in using any third-party provider, you
			consent to our using the email address in accordance with our Privacy
			Policy.
