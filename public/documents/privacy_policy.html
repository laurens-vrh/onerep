		<h1>OneRep Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on August 22, 2024.</p>
		<p>
			By visiting or using OneRep and related services (the “Service”), you are
			accepting the practices described in this notice (the “Privacy Policy”).
			If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our
			website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it
			and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy
			Policy are effective when they are posted on the website.
		</p>

		<h2>User Content</h2>
		<p>
			The Service allows you to post User Content, as defined in our Terms of
			Service. Any User Content you post becomes available to the public via the
			Service, with the exception of uploaded files, like sheet music, and
			private notes. User Content includes, but is not limited to, compositions,
			composers and lists. If you remove User Content, copies may remain
			viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or
			stored your User Content. OneRep takes reasonable measures to keep any
			uploaded documents private, but does not guarantee the security and
			availability of these documents.
		</p>

		<h2>E-mail and Other Information</h2>
		<p>
			By providing OneRep your e-mail address, directly or when signing in using
			any third-party provider, you consent to us sending you Service-related
			notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication
			by postal mail. You may not opt out of these Service-related e-mails. To
			the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request
			access to or delete your personal information. To do so, you may select
			the “Delete Account” option under the “Account” button in the top menu,
			when using the Service. You may, of course, decline to submit personally
			identifiable information through OneRep, in which case OneRep may not be
			able to provide certain services to you.
		</p>

		<h2>Cookies and Other Identifiers</h2>
		<p>
			To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide
			and improve the Service, we use cookies and other identifiers.
		</p>

		<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
		<p>
			Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that
			reason, OneRep does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information
			from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to
			register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about
			yourself to us, including your name or e-mail address. No one under age 13
			is allowed to provide any personal information to or on OneRep. In the
			event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a
			child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will
			delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we
			might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact
			us.
